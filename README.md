# hello-world
Nothing to see here.

I don't know what I'm doing with my life, hopefully coding is the direction I want to go. We only have one chance, can't screw this one up. I work at a factory full of uncreative people I don't synergize with well. Hopefully the few I do click with I can pull them out with me to a life full of wonder, fullfillment and happiness. Wish me the best.
